# thorlabs_thermistor_arduino
This is a code for a temperature measurement by using 10k Thorlabs thermistor (TH10K). 10k thermistor and 10k ohm resistor are connected in series and the voltage is measure analog pin (A0) as shown in the diagram (voltage divider). The voltage is converted to the resistance of the thermistor and  later on converted into temperature.

The body temperature is measure and compare with the digital thermometer.
